Image Classification: Happy or Sad Person
Project Overview
This repository focuses on image classification, specifically determining whether a person in an image is happy or sad. The project includes:

Data Cleaning: Ensuring high-quality images for robust model training.
Preprocessing: Scaling pixel values between 0 and 1 to enhance model performance.
Deep Learning Model: Constructing a powerful model using TensorFlow and Keras.
Model Training: Training on a dataset containing happy and sad images.
Performance Evaluation: Assessing the model using precision, recall, and binary accuracy metrics.
Streamlit Web Application: Offering a user-friendly interface for real-time image classification.
Project Structure
data/: Contains image datasets for happy and sad people.
models/: Holds the saved trained model (happysadmodel.h5).
image_classification.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook with the complete project pipeline.
app.py: Streamlit web application for live image classification.
Usage
##Usage

*Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ImageClassification.git
cd ImageClassification

*Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

*Run the Streamlit app:
streamlit run app.py

Upload an image and see the model predict whether the person is happy or sad.

##Results
Trained a deep learning model achieving high accuracy on the validation set.
Deployed a Streamlit web application for real-time image classification.
